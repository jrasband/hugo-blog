In standardized education the primary purpose of an exam is to measure how much
a student is "worth." This is wrong. The primary purpose of an exam should be to
determine what the student knows.

What is it that people do with exam grades? They use them to compare students
against each other, as a way to determine which students are "better" than other
students. A grade serves much the same function as a price in a marketplace---it
abstracts away all of the details until you have a single number that you can
use to compare unlike things. Grades are one of the primary metrics for
determining whether a student will be admitted to a university, admitted to a
doctoral program, or offered an internship or job. The primary purpose of exam
grades is therefore to determine which students are "better" or "worse" than
others, because that is how people use grades.

I think it's wrong to abstract away all information about a student's knowledge
until all that is left is a single, crude numeric measure. When a teacher (or a
student) sees a grade, it is an extremely imprecise error signal.

The purpose of teaching is learning, and learning is better served by a precise
error signal, one which gives the student and the teacher feedback about what
the student does know and what the student doesn't know. Exams and grading must
be structured so that they are a measure of knowledge and knowledge gaps. Until
then, exams will be a measure of "worth," and students who do poorly on exams
will view themselves as being unworthy or less valuable when they instead should
view themselves as just not knowing something yet.
