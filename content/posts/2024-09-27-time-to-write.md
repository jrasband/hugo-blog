I think that the next phase of my self-education is writing. Here's why:

**Writing generates an error signal:** Writing externalizes your thought process,
which makes it easier to reflect on which of your thoughts need to improve.

**Writing is a form of retrieval practice:** Retrieval practice is the best
known technique for building and strengthening long-term memory.

These two factors make writing a highly efficient learning technique.

Because I've previously had a hard time writing consistently, I'm making a
commitment: for the next month (until October 27th, 2024), I will write one blog
post every day. They probably won't be very long (or very good), but I'm going to
write them.
